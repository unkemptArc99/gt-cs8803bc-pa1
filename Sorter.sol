/*
 * TESTS
 * We will test your code with our test cases by calling 'truffle test'
 * We are using truffle's automated testing framework
 * We wrote the tests in Solidity but it is also possible to use JavaScript's Mocha framework
 * Learn how to test: https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-solidity
 * 10 test cases, each is worth 8 points (5 test cases for iterative bubble sort, 5 for recursive)
 * You are encouraged to write your own test cases
 *
 * ORDER
 * Sort from SMALLEST TO LARGEST uint
 *
 * EXAMPLES
 * Input: uint[] array = [4,3,2,3];
 * Output: uint[] expected = [2,3,3,4];
 *
 * NOTE
 * We WILL VERIFY you wrote an iterative/recursive bubble sort as instructed
 * Writing two iterative or two recursive solutions will result in 0 points for the whole assignment
